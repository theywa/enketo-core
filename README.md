===============

The engine that powers [Enketo Smart Paper](https://enketo.org) and various third party tools including [these](https://enketo.org/about/adoption/).

This repo is meant to use as a building block for any Enketo-powered application. See [this page](https://enketo.org/develop/#libraries) for a schematic overview of an Enketo-powered application and how Enketo Core fits into this.

Follow the [Enketo blog](http://blog.enketo.org) or [Enketo on twitter](https://twitter.com/enketo) to stay up to date.

### Usage as a library

1. Install with `npm install enketo-core --save` or include as a git submodule.
2. Develop a way to perform an [XSL Transformation](https://enketo.org/develop/#transformation) on OpenRosa-flavoured XForms inside your app. The transformation will output an XML instance and a HTML form. See [enketo-transformer](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-transformer) for an available library/app to use or develop your own.
3. Add [themes](./src/sass) to your stylesheet build system (2 stylesheets per theme, 1 is for `media="print"`).
4. Override [config.json](./config.json) and optionally [widgets.js](./src/js/widgets.js) with your app-specific versions.
5. Main methods illustrated in code below:

```javascript 
var Form = require('enketo-core');

// The XSL transformation result contains a HTML Form and XML instance.
// These can be obtained dynamically on the client, or at the server/
// In this example we assume the HTML was injected at the server and modelStr 
// was injected as a global variable inside a <script> tag.

// required string of the jquery selector of the HTML Form DOM element
var formSelector = 'form.or:eq(0)';

// required object containing data for the form
var data = {
  // required string of the default instance defined in the XForm
  modelStr: globalXMLInstance,
  // optional string of an existing instance to be edited
  instanceStr: null,
  // optional boolean whether this instance has ever been submitted before
  submitted: false,
  // optional array of external data objects containing: 
  // {id: 'someInstanceId', xmlStr: '<root>external instance content</root>'}
  external: [],
  // optional object of session properties 
  // 'deviceid', 'username', 'email', 'phonenumber', 'simserial', 'subscriberid'
  session: {}
};

// form-specific configuration
var options = {
  clearIrrelevantImmediately: true  // this is the default, it can be omitted
}

// instantiate a form, with 2 parameters
var form = new Form( formSelector, data, options);

// initialize the form and capture any load errors
var loadErrors = form.init();

// submit button handler for validate button
$( '#submit' ).on( 'click', function() {
  // clear irrelevant questions and validate
  form.validate()
    .then(function (valid){
      if ( !valid ) {
        alert( 'Form contains errors. Please see fields marked in red.' );
      } else {
        // Record is valid! 
        var record = form.getDataStr();

        // reset the form view
        form.resetView();
            
        // reinstantiate a new form with the default model and no options
        form = new Form( formSelector, { modelStr: modelStr }, {} );

        // do what you want with the record
      }
    });
} );

```

### Browser support

The following browsers are officially supported:
* latest Android webview on latest Android OS
* latest WKWebView on latest iOS
* latest version of Chrome/Chromium on OS X, Linux, Windows, Android and iOS
* latest version of Firefox on OS X, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS
* latest version of Safari on OS X, Windows, and on the latest version of iOS
* latest version of Microsoft Edge

We have to admit we do not test on all of these, but are committed to fixing browser-specific bugs that are reported for these browsers. Naturally, older browsers versions will often work as well - they are just not officially supported.
Note that some applications using Enketo Core (e.g. Enketo Express) may have more limited browser support. 

### Global Configuration

Global configuration (per app) is done in [config.json](./config.json) which is meant to be overriden by a config file in your own application (e.g. by using aliasify).

#### maps
The `maps` configuration can include an array of Mapbox TileJSON objects (or a subset of these with at least a `name`,  `tiles` (array) and an `attribution` property, and optionally `maxzoom` and `minzoom`). You can also mix and match Google Maps layers. Below is an example of a mix of two map layers provided by OSM (in TileJSON format) and Google maps.

```
[ 
  {
    "name": "street",
    "tiles": [ "http://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" ],
    "attribution": "Map data Â© <a href=\"http://openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors"
  }, 
  {
    "name": "satellite",
    "tiles": "GOOGLE_SATELLITE"
  } 
]
```

For GMaps layers you have the four options as tiles values: `"GOOGLE_SATELLITE"`, `"GOOGLE_ROADMAP"`, `"GOOGLE_HYBRID"`, `"GOOGLE_TERRAIN"`. You can also add other TileJSON properties, such as minZoom, maxZoom, id to all layers. 

#### googleApiKey
The Google API key that is used for geolocation (in the geo widgets' search box). Can be obtained [here](https://console.developers.google.com/project). Make sure to enable the _GeoCoding API_ service. If you are using Google Maps layers, the same API key is used. Make sure to enable the _Google Maps JavaScript API v3_ service as well in that case (see next item).

#### validateContinuously
This setting with the default `false` value determines whether Enketo should validate questions immediately if a related value changes. E.g. if question A has a constraint that depends on question B, this mode would re-validate question A if the value for question B changes. **This mode will slow down form traversal.** When set to `false` that type of validation is only done at the end when the Submit button is clicked or in Pages mode when the user clicks Next.

#### validatePage
This setting with default `true` value determines whether the Next button should trigger validation of the current page and block the user from moving to the next page if validation fails.

### Form Configuration

Per-form configuration is done by adding an (optional) options object as 3rd parameter when instantiating a form.

#### Behaviour of skip logic

```
new Form(formselector, data, { 
  clearIrrelevantImmediately: false
});
```

If `clearIrrelevantImmediately` is set to `true` or not set at all, Enketo will clear the value of a question as soon as it becomes irrelevant, after loading (so while the user traverses the form). If it is set to `false` Enketo will leave the values intact (and just hide the question).

In the second case the irrelevant values will not be cleared until `form.validate()` is called (usually when the user marks a record as complete).

### How to develop Enketo Core

1. install [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)
2. install dependencies with `npm install`
3. build with `grunt`
4. start built-in auto-reloading development server with `grunt develop` 
5. browse to [http://localhost:8005](http://localhost:8005/) and load an XForm url with the `xform` queryparameter or load a local from from the /tests/forms folder in this repo
6. run tests with `npm test`
7. adding the querystring `touch=true` and reducing the window size allows you to simulate mobile touchscreens

### How to create or extend widgets

To create new widgets, we recommend using this [plugin template](https://gist.github.com/MartijnR/6943281). The option {touch: [boolean]}, is added automatically to all widgets to indicate whether the client is using a touchscreen device.

Each widget needs to fulfill following requirements:

* be a CommonJS jQuery plugin
* it needs to return an object with its own name and selector-to-instantiate with
* path to stylesheet scss file relative to the widget's own folder to be added in [_widgets.scss](./src/sass/core/_widgets.scss) (this will be automated in the future)
* be responsive up to a minimum window width of 320px
* use JSDoc style documentation
* if hiding the original input element, it needs to load the default value from that input element into the widget
* if hiding the original input element, it needs to stay synchronized with the widget and a `change` event should be triggered on the original whenever it changes value
* if hiding the original input element, the widget value needs to update when the original input updates due to a calculation
* it is recommended to apply the `widget` css class to any new elements it adds to the DOM (but not to their children)
* new input/select/textarea elements inside widgets need to get the `ignore` class
* it requires the following methods (which can be automatically obtained by extending the Widget base class as demonstrated in the [plugin template](https://gist.github.com/MartijnR/6943281)
  * `enable()` to enable the widget when a disabled ancestor gets enabled. This may be an empty function if that happens automatically.
  * `disable()` This may be an empty function if the widgets gets disabled automatically cross-browser when its branch becomes irrelevant.
  * `update()` to update the widget when called after the content used to instantiate it has changed (language or options). In its simplest form this could simply call destroy() and then re-initialize the widget, or be an empty function if language changes are handled automatically and it is not a `<select>` widget.
* if the widget needs tweaks or needs to be disabled for mobile (touchscreen) use, build this in. The option `{ touch: [boolean] }` is passed to the plugin by default. If your widget requires tweaks for mobile, you could create an all-in-one widget using the `options.touch` check or you could create separate widgets for desktop and mobile (as done with select-desktop and select-mobile widgets)
* allow clearing of the original input (i.e. setting value to '')
* send a `fakefocus` and `fakeblur` event to the original input when the widget gets focus or looses it (see select-desktop)
* please write test specs in the widget's /test folder.....(yeah, we need to do that for the existing widgets too...)

### Notes for JavaScript Developers

* JavaScript style see [JsBeautifier](./.jsbeautifyrc) config file, the jsbeautifier check is added to the grunt `test` task. You can also manually run `grunt jsbeautifier:fix` to fix style issues.
* Testing is done with Jasmine and Karma (all: `grunt karma`, headless: `grunt karma:headless`, browsers: `grunt karma:browsers`)
* When making a pull request, please add tests where relevant

### Notes for CSS Developers

The core can be fairly easily extended with alternative themes. 
See the *plain*, the *grid*, and the *formhub* themes already included in [/src/sass](./src/sass). 
We would be happy to discuss whether your contribution should be a part of the core, the default theme or be turned into a new theme. 

For custom themes that go beyond just changing colors and fonts, keep in mind all the different contexts for a theme:

1. non-touchscreen vs touchscreen (add ?touch=true during development)
2. default one-page-mode and multiple-pages-mode
3. right-to-left form language vs left-to-right form language (!) - also the UI-language may have a different directionality
4. screen view vs. print view
5. questions inside a (nested) repeat group have a different background
6. large screen size --> smaller screen size ---> smallest screen size 
7. question in valid vs. invalid state
